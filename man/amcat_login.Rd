Authenticate to an AmCAT instance

\details{
Enabling refresh token rotation ensures added security as leaked
refresh tokens also become invalidated after a short while. It is currently
disabled by default as it is not fully supported by the underlying httr2
package.

If you select to store your tokens on disk in the interactive menu, they
are stored in the location indicated by
\code{rappdirs::user_cache_dir("httr2")}.

The function needs to open a browser, which will usually only work in an
interactive session. However, you can save the returned object in an rds
file (with \code{saveRDS()}) and tell amcat4r where to look for it:
\code{options(amcat4r_token_cache = "path/to/location/tokens.rds")}. If you
still have issues in an interactive session, check \link[utils]{browseURL}
to see if you can set a browser manually.
